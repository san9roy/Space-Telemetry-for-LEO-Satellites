# Space-Telemetry-for-LEO-Satellites
This project presents a physics-inspired spacecraft telemetry simulation and anomaly detection framework that models power, thermal, and communication subsystems in Low Earth Orbit. It combines engineering-based thresholds and machine learning to analyze synthetic telemetry and study fault detection and spacecraft health monitoring.
